# Machine Learning Model Comparison

This project compares multiple machine learning models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, SVR, KNN, etc.)
on the Konzas dataset to evaluate their performance using R² and MSE metrics.

## Structure
- **data/** → datasets (e.g., Konzas.csv)
- **notebooks/** → Jupyter/Colab notebooks
- **src/** → reusable Python scripts
- **models/** → trained models (.pkl, .joblib)
- **results/** → charts, evaluation reports
- **utils/** → helper scripts
